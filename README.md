## Description

This game is a small demo of a concept conceived during C# Team Week. The original idea for the game was an RPG, where the main character is on a quest to learn code, and solve puzzles in a code school "dungeon." To progress through the dungeon, the main character must correct the small code snippets that are written on the floor to open the door to the next room. There are currently 3 sample rooms in the demo.
